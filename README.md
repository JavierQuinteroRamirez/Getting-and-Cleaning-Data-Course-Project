Course 3 => Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is README file from Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. We can find here the instructions on how to get the analysis on Human Activity Recognition extracted from wearable devices dataset.


    * CodeBook.md => The variables, the data and the process to clean the data according to the requirements established for this activity are described here.
    
    * run_analysis.R => In first instance the data is prepared and then we followed by this steps:
            
            - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
            - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
            - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
            - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
            - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
              variable for each activity and each subject.

    * Data.txt => This is final result from all activities described.
